# FortunateCookiesApp
This is the Varsity Virtual Business app for the 2021-2022 year. Virtual Business is a school class in which the class creates a real-life business but in a virtual world. The business this year was a fortune cookie company. I am this year's app developer and created the Fortunate Cookies Rewards App. With this application, users can browse our selection of cookies and place orders. Once an order is placed, users will get points on the app for their purchase. Once enough points have been reached, they can claim a prize that will be emailed to them.
